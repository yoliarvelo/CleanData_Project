## Objectives of the R script:
This set of functions create a data frame that contains
the average of each mean or std variable for each activity and each subject
obtained from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy 
S smartphone in an experiment performed by UCI university.

##Requirements of the R script: 
* getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file must be downloaded and unzipped to the working directory when running the script.
The zip file can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* the following libraries are required: dplyr

## To know how the objective was implemented using this script please refer to the script itself.
